chreejt.fa is a made-up chromosome from /n/facility/Bioinformatics/analysis/Blanchette/ArrayDesignDrosophila/design/EEJT.fa using /home/mcm/utilities/concatfasta.pl to concatenate all the junctions together with 50 N's between each one. It is used to prevent AOS from designing probes that match the junction regions.
